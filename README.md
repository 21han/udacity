##  Udacity Project Collections

What's the point of all the late night learnings if a man doesn't share his knowledge? This project dedicates to documenting my learning progress.

## Motivation

+ Inventory for knowledge queries. (I will forget things like how to do regex in Python and I know where to look for such tutorials)
+ Consolidate learning by act of documenting and re-organizing learning materials
+ **Optional**: ideally, I want to pull some time to implement learning concepts to different settings. For example, how about we test the Sentiment Neural Network on Cryptocurrency for example. With more active learning, I hope to cultivate more skills and more in depth thinkings (something that the programs themselves won't teach directly). One has to learn by actively creating from existing concepts.
