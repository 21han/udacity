##  Udacity Project Collections

What's the point of all the late night learnings if a man(woman) doesn't share his(her) knowledge? This project dedicates to documenting learning on Udacity, whether the learning come from a course or a Nanodegree program.

## Motivation

+ Inventory for knowledge queries. (we might forget things like how to do regex in Python and we know where to look for such tutorials)
+ Consolidate learning by act of documenting and re-organizing learning materials
+ **Optional**: ideally, we want to pull some time to implement learning concepts to different settings. For example, how about we test the Sentiment Neural Network on Cryptocurrency for example. With more active learning, we hope to cultivate more skills and more in depth thinkings (something that the programs themselves won't teach directly). One has to learn by actively creating from existing concepts.
